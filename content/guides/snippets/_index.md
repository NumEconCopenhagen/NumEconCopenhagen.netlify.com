# Why
This course is about providing solutions to the economic problems will face or have faced at the bachelor programme. We would really like that the best students' best solution is integrated in the course. This guide shows you how you can provide a solution to the course (you will of course be accordingly accredited for the solution).

## Forking and making a pull request
At Github you're able to fork any public repository that you don't own. Basically, a fork is a copy of an another persons or organizations repository where you can commit to the project. Not only, are you able to commit to the project, but you can also make a suggestion to the owner of the repository to include your changes or additions to the project. This is a very good way to show your programming skills. 

NumEcon has a organization page where all there course's repositories is stored. First, I'll show how to fork the NumEcon's repository. The next things that happens is that I clone the forked repository to my local computer, and open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code. Then I add a line to the readme, and commit the line to my local forked repository. Then if I go to Github that tells me that my forked repository is ahead of the original repository, and asks if I want to create a pull request which I do. Then the owner can include the changes into the original repository. I was able to do so because I have owner permission over the repository on Github.
