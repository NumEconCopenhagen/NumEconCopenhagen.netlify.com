Jupyter notebook is awesome way of combining writing and coding in the same framework. If you haven't seen a Jupyter Notebook before it looks like this.

## Installation

The far easiest way of installing _Jupyter Notebook_ is by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) because _Anaconda_ ships with _Jupyter Notebook_^["Ships with" means that _Anaconda_ will automatically install _Jupyter Notebook_ when it is installed itself.]. We have written you a guide of our suggestions to a basic setup suited for this course that can be found [here](/guides/python-installation/).

## Jupyter Notebook - The basics

We assume that you've followed our suggestion of installing _Anaconda_.  

-----

First of all, we need to know how we fire up a _Jupyter Notebook_. If you are using a Windows machine open the program `CMD`, if you are using a mac or are using Linux distribution open the program `Terminal`. At first, the terminal can appear very intimidating but do not worry, you will get to know the terminal as you go along this course. In the terminal, write the following piece of code: `jupyter notebook`. Hopefully, you will experience that you browser automatically opens a new tab or that your terminal shows a link. It should look similar to either the left or right side of beneath.

If, your browser doesn't open a new tab that looks like the right part of the figure above you should copy the link in your terminal that begins with `http://localhost:8888?token=...` and paste it into your browser. Afterwards you should see something similar to that of the screenshot above.

### Creating a notebook

To create new notebook click on `new` in the upper right corner, and then choose `Python 3` from the dropdown menu. As shown below:

These are the basics. A more in depth introduction is given [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)
