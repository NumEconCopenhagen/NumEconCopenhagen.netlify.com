# NumEconCopenhagen.netlify.com

This repository is the workhorse of the webpage numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com. We are using the awesome static build generator [Hugo](gohugo.io/
) to generate the underlying html structure of the webpage, and using the _free_ hosting service at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/
) to let the world access our course site.

## Build webpage

The easiest way to build the webpage is to install node.js.

- Install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Run `git clone https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/NumEconCopenhagen.netlify.com`
- Change your directory to _NumEconCopenhagen.netlify.com_
- Run `npm install` (Once, afterwards it's not required to run this command.)
- Run `npm run hugo` to build the site or Run `npm run hugo-serve` to show the site.
