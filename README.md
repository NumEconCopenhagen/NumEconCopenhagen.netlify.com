# NumEconCopenhagen.netlify.com

This is repository is the workhorse of the webpage numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com. We are using the awesome static build generator [Hugo](gohugo.io/
) to generate the underlying html structure of the webpage, and using the _free_ hosting service at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/
) to let the world access our course site.
