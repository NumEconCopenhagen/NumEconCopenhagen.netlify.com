Basically, A _Github Issue_ is a way of communicating a bug, request or something else related to a specific Project hosted on Github. This guide only shows how to create an issue heavily inspired by this [post](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). [This thorough introduction to mastering _Github Issues_](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) is recommended.

### Creating a Github Issue

Please read this [post](https://medium.com/nycplanninglabs/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f) that explains how to create a quality issue.

1. Go to the main page of a repository e.g. https://www.github.com/numeconcopenhagen/lectures-2019
2. In the repositories navigation bar you would see banner named _Issues_. Click on it.
3. Click on _New Issue_
4. Give the issue an appropriate name so it is clear to other people and your future you what the issue is about.
5. Explain your problem, and what you've attempted to do.
