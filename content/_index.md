title: "Welcome to Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis"
---

This course introduces you to programming and enables you to numerically solve simple economic models and perform basic data analysis. This will e.g. allow you to both visualize solutions, easily test assumptions with respect to functional forms and parameters, and consider more realistic models, which are solvable numerically but not algebraically. 

We will mostly use the **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** programming language, and focus on well-known  microeconomic and macroeconomic models from the core bachelor courses (Edgeworth, Koopman, Solow, AS-AD etc.). The course requires you to get your hands dirty, programming is not a spectator sport.

All students attending the course will receive 6 months of free access to **[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home)** (you will receive an e-mail regarding this). In the first classes you will follow online courses at DataCamp to learn the basics of Python. For details, see the **[course plan](/course-plan/)**  

The course is centered arround three GitHub repositories:

1. **[lectures-2019](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/lectures-2019)**: Slides and code for the lectures ([interactive version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NumEconCopenhagen/lectures-2019/master))

# Course Description

This course introduces you to programming and enables you to numerically solve simple economic models and perform basic data analysis. This will e.g. allow you to both visualize solutions, easily test assumptions with respect to functional forms and parameters, and consider more realistic models, which are solvable numerically but not algebraically. 

The course requires no prior experience with programming.

The first part of the course introduces you to programming using the general-purpose Python language. You will learn to write conditional statements, loops, functions, and classes, and to print results and produce static and interactive plots. You will learn to solve simple numerical optimization problems, and draw random number and run simulations. You will learn to test, debug and document your code, and use online communities proactively when writing code. 

The second part of the course give you a brief introduction on how to import data from offline and online sources, structure it, and produce central descriptive statistics. You will learn to estimate simple statistical models on your data.

The third part of the course introduce you to the concept of a numerical algorithm. You will learn how to write simple searching, sorting and optimization algorithms. You will learn to solve linear algebra problems, solve non-linear equations numerically and symbolically, find fixed points, and solve complicated numerical optimization problems relying on function approximation.

You will get hands-on experience with applying the above techniques to solve well-known microeconomic and macroeconomic problems from the core bachelor courses. Specifically, you will work with both a small data analysis project, and a larger model analysis project based on a well-known economic model.

While the course only focus on programming in Python, you will also be equipped to start learning other programming languages (such as MATLAB, R, Julia or even C/C++) on your own.
